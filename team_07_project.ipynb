    "To ensure that all tasks like the analysis and the feature engineering are conducted on the same, consistent dataset, a custom data manager class has been created. The data manager provides methods, that are needed and can be re-used in multiple tasks (e.g. retrieval of orders with tip information for the training dataset). Since the data management functionality is encapsulated in the data manager, the room for errors caused by redundant implementations is reduced and the code is more maintainable, because methods can be adjusted in a single location."

The period in the early morning, where the tip probability is higher, includes the hours 0-4 (from 12 until 5 a.m.). At hour 5 a significant drop in the tip probability can be observed. The tip probability remains relatively constant during the day with a slight increase in the morning hours. Since the change in the tip probability is not as drastic as in the early morning and doesn't reach the same level as in the early morning or the evening, this increase is not considered significant. At hour 19, the tip probability increases abruptly and remains at a high level until hour 23 (7 p.m. until 12 a.m.). Therefore the hours 0-4 and 19-23 are considered as the hours with a high tip probability.\n",

In the hours with a high tip probability, the number of orders is significantly lower than during the day. This is particularly noticeable in the early morning hours, where the number of orders is very low. Therefore, the significant increase in the tip probability in the early morning hours is not as relevant as the increase in the evening, where the number of orders is higher. Despite this fact, no differentiation was made between the early morning and the evening, for simplicity reasons and since the tip probability is very similar in both periods, which cover a continuous time span (7 p.m. until 5 a.m.) when combined.\n",

This also reduces the significance of the tip probability in the right plot for higher order numbers, because the number of orders is very low.

    "##### **Product Analysis**\n",
    "**Analysis:** The analysis of the product was conducted to find out whether specific products have a higher tip probability than others. For this analysis, multiple plots and tables were created to visualize the tip probability of the products:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First plot: The first plot visualizes the distribution of products depending on the probability, that orders containing these products are tipped. The products are grouped into 100 bins, which means that every bin contains products with a tip probability between 0 and 0.01, 0.01 and 0.02, and so on. The plot shows the number of products in each bin.\n",
    "- Second plot: The second plot visualizes the same distribution, but this time the products were weighted by how often they were ordered. This was done to judge the significance of the tip probability of the products. The plot shows the number of orders containing products in each bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third plot: The third plot displays the same distribution of products as the first plot, but in a more fine grained way. Only products with a tip probability between 80% and 100% are shown, grouped into 20 bins.\n",
    "- Fourth plot: The fourth plot visualizes the same distribution as the third plot, but the products were weighted by how often they were ordered.\n",
    "- Table 1: The table shows products with a 100% tip probability, that don't belong to the alcohol department, sorted by the number of orders containing these products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fifth plot: The fifth plot is equivalent to the third plot, but only products with a tip probability between 0% and 20% are shown, grouped into 20 bins.\n",
    "- Sixth plot: The sixth plot is equivalent to the fifth plot, but the products were weighted by how often they were ordered.\n",
    "- Table 2: The table shows products with a 0% tip probability, sorted by the number of orders containing these products.\n",
    "- Last plot: The last plot shows the distribution of products with a tip probability of 0% depending on the number of orders containing these products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all plots, products from the alcohol department are highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result Interpretation:**\n",
    "When looking at the first and the second plot, one can see, that the tip probability varies between different products. The distribution of the tip probability of the products is not uniform, but rather resembles a normal distribution, except there are noticeable peaks at 0% and 100%. Once the products are weighted by how often they were ordered, the peaks at 0% and 100% disappear and the distribution becomes more uniform. This leads to the conclusion that these products are not ordered very often and therefore the tip probability is not very significant. Only a small elevation can be observed starting at around 80% tip probability, which indicates that there are some products with a high tip probability, that are ordered more often than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third and forth plot, this is examined in more detail. The unweighted plot on the left shows that there are many products, which do not belong to the alcohol department and have a tip probability between 80% and 100%. There is also a large peak of products, that are tipped every time they are ordered. However, when looking at the weighted plot on the right, this peak shrinks drastically. It also becomes clear that the alcohol products are extremely dominant in this area and that the other products are not ordered very often, when looking at the weighted plot. This leads to the conclusion that the tip probability of the alcohol products is rather significant, while the tip probability of the other products is not. The table 1 confirms this, as it shows that the products, which do not belong to the alcohol department and have a 100% tip probability, appear in 7 orders at most. When considering that in the dataset as a whole, products are ordered an average of 653 times, with a median order frequency of 60 times, it becomes clear that the non-alcohol products with a 100% tip probability are not very significant. Therefore, a feature using a curated list of products that are tipped every time (or above 80%) would not be very useful, since most of these products are alcohol products or are not ordered very often.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar observation can be made for the products with a tip probability between 0% and 20%. The unweighted plot on the left shows that there are many products with a low tip probability with a significant peak at 0%. But when looking at the weighted plot on the right, it becomes clear that these products are also not ordered very often, as the peak at 0% shrinks drastically. Table 2 shows, that the products with a 0% tip probability are ordered 22 times at most, which is more significant than the products with a 100% tip probability, but still low. The last plot gives a more detailed view of the distribution of the products with a 0% tip probability. It shows that the products with a 0% tip probability are ordered very rarely, with the majority of them being ordered only 3 times. Not many of these products are ordered more than 10 times. Therefore, a feature using a curated list of products that are never tipped would also not be very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "&rarr; **Impact of product**: The analysis showed that products that are always/never tipped are not very significant, since they are not ordered very often. Therefore, no feature was created to capture the relationship between the tip probability and a curated list of products that are always/never tipped. To allow the model to utilize the information that some products are more likely to be tipped than others, which is clearly visible in the first/second plot, the generic feature **product_tip_rate** was created, which is described further in the feature analysis section."

To compare the \"add to card order\" of a product, the rational scaled variable (add_to_card_order) has to be normalized. With that normalization every \"add to cart order\" is transformed to an additional normalized_add_to_card attribute order within the interval [0,1].

Within these bins the mean tip probability of every product is calculated and visualized within the box plot below.\n",

Considering the area between the 25th and 75th quartile, it can be recognized that there is no overall impact of the normalized add_to_card oder on the product specific tip probability. Focussing the outliers, it can be seen that there are some differences between the different bins. However, because the range between the 25th and 75th percentile is so constant, it can be assumed that these outliers are not necessarily related to \"add to card or\" but are due to other influences.\\\n",

With a high reordered rate we can assume that the product has been bought quite often across all users. The heatmap below shows the product tip probability in comparison to the reordered rate. The purpose of this analysis task was to identify weather the reordered rate has an overall influence of the tip probability. The assumption here was that the tip probability of the products generally increases with a rising reordered rate.\n",
